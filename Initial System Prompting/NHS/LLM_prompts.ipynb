      "Rationale: A box plot is useful for understanding the distribution of sales within each product category.

      "1. Scatter Plot\n",
      "Rationale: A scatter plot is appropriate for visualizing the relationship between customer age and income. It allows the user to assess if there is any correlation between these two variables. For example, it could show if older customers tend to have higher incomes or if income is more evenly distributed across different age groups.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Heatmap\n",
      "Rationale: A heatmap is a great way to visualize correlations between multiple continuous variables. In this case, a correlation matrix of Age, Income, and Spending can be displayed to help the user understand the relationships between these numerical variables. The heatmap will show which variables have strong positive or negative correlations with each other.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Violin Plot\n",
      "Rationale: A violin plot is useful for comparing the distribution of a continuous variable (such as income) across categories (e.g., gender, product type). It combines aspects of both box plots and kernel density plots, showing the spread and density of the data. In this case, it can be used to compare the income distribution between different customer types (e.g., gender or product preference).\n",

      "# Final Instructions:\n",
      "1. Choose Visualizations Carefully: Select visualizations that best match the datasetâ€™s characteristics and user goals. For instance, use line charts for time-based data, bar charts for categorical comparisons, and scatter plots for numerical relationships. Remember that the visualizations shouldn't require the dataset to be changed in anyway (you cannot modify the data for input in the chosen visualizations)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Column-to-Input Mappings: Ensure that the column names are mapped correctly to each visualizationâ€™s input fields (e.g., X-axis, Y-axis).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Provide Clear Rationale: Justify each visualization choice in terms of the insights it provides, explaining how the visualization will help the user understand the datasetâ€™s structure.\n",

      "1. Scatter Plot\n",
      "Rationale: A scatter plot is appropriate for visualizing the relationship between customer age and income. It allows the user to assess if there is any correlation between these two variables.

It combines aspects of both box plots and kernel density plots, showing the spread and density of the data. In this case, it can be used to compare the income distribution between different customer types (e.g., gender or product preference).\n",

      "# Final Instructions:\n",
      "1. Choose Visualizations Carefully: Select visualizations that best match the datasetâ€™s characteristics and user goals. For instance, use line charts for time-based data, bar charts for categorical comparisons, and scatter plots for numerical relationships. Remember that the visualizations shouldn't require the dataset to be changed in anyway (you cannot modify the data for input in the chosen visualizations)\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Scatter Plot Matrix (Pair Plot)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rationale:** Given the presence of multiple continuous numerical features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), a pair plot is an ideal way to visualize the relationships between all pairs of these variables. It allows for a quick assessment of potential correlations and patterns, which is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of the data. The 'target' column can be used for color-coding to see if the species are easily separable based on these features.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Column Mapping:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   `data`: DataFrame containing `sepal length (cm)`, `sepal width (cm)`, `petal length (cm)`, and `petal width (cm)`.\n",
      "    *   `hue`: `target` (for color-coding by species)\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Box Plot**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rationale:** Box plots are excellent for comparing the distribution of each feature across the different target categories (species). It provides a clear view of the median, quartiles, and outliers, helping to identify which features are most discriminative between the species. This addresses the question of how the different features are distributed based on the target variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Column Mapping:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   `x`: `target` (Categorical column representing the species)\n",
      "    *   `y`: One of the numerical features: `sepal length (cm)`, `sepal width (cm)`, `petal length (cm)`, or `petal width (cm)` (create a separate box plot for each feature).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Heatmap**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rationale:** The correlation matrix provided in the metadata shows the relationships between all numerical variables, including the 'target' variable. Visualizing this matrix as a heatmap can make these relationships easier to understand at a glance. It helps identify which features are strongly correlated with each other and with the target variable, which is essential for feature selection and understanding the dataset.\n",

Given that the years 2014-2023 are represented as columns, a line chart can effectively display how the values for each country have changed over this period. This will help identify growth patterns, declines, or any significant fluctuations in value.\n",

      "        * Color: Country (to differentiate between countries)\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Bar Chart (Horizontal)**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** A horizontal bar chart is most effective to compare the data across different countries for a specific year. This is because there are so many countries, the horizontal bar chart is the most effective way to see which are the highest.\n",
      "    *   **Column Mapping:**\n",
      "        *   x: Numerical data of the specific year\n",
      "        *   y: Country\n",
      "3.  **Map (Choropleth)**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** As there is geographical data available a map would be the perfect visualization. This will help the user understand the spatial distribution of values. Used for Geospatial analysis (e.g., population, sales by region).\n",

      "### Example 1: Output for a Dataset with Sales Data\n",
      "1. Bar Chart (Vertical)\n",
      "Rationale: A bar chart is an excellent choice for comparing the total sales by product category. It will help the user quickly assess which product categories are performing better than others. This type of visualization is particularly useful when comparing discrete categories such as product types or regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Column Mapping:\n",
      "\n",
      "x: Product Category (Categorical column describing product types)\n",
      "\n",
      "height: Sales (Numerical column representing the total sales for each product category)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Line Chart\n",
      "Rationale: A line chart is the best option for visualizing sales trends over time. It helps the user understand how sales change over a period, which is crucial for identifying seasonal trends, growth patterns, or any fluctuations. The Date column will be used for the x-axis, and the Sales column will represent the sales values over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Column Mapping:\n",
      "\n",
      "x: Date (Date/Time column showing the date of each sale)\n",
      "\n",
      "y: Sales (Numerical column representing the total sales on that date)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Box Plot\n",
      "Rationale: A box plot is useful for understanding the distribution of sales within each product category. It shows the median, range, quartiles, and any outliers, providing insights into the consistency of sales across different product categories. It can highlight any irregular patterns or extreme sales values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Column Mapping:\n",
      "\n",
      "x: Product Category (Categorical column describing product types)\n",
      "\n",
      "y: Sales (Numerical column representing sales values)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example 2: Output for a Dataset with Customer Information\n",
      "1. Scatter Plot\n",
      "Rationale: A scatter plot is appropriate for visualizing the relationship between customer age and income. It allows the user to assess if there is any correlation between these two variables. For example, it could show if older customers tend to have higher incomes or if income is more evenly distributed across different age groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Column Mapping:\n",
      "\n",
      "x: Age (Continuous numerical column representing the customer's age)\n",

      "y: Income (Continuous numerical column representing the customer's income)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Heatmap\n",
      "Rationale: A heatmap is a great way to visualize correlations between multiple continuous variables. In this case, a correlation matrix of Age, Income, and Spending can be displayed to help the user understand the relationships between these numerical variables. The heatmap will show which variables have strong positive or negative correlations with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Column Mapping:\n",

      "data: Correlation matrix between Age, Income, and Spending (Numerical columns representing customer attributes)\n",
      "\n",
      "cmap: 'coolwarm' (Optional color map to visually differentiate correlation strength)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Violin Plot\n",
      "Rationale: A violin plot is useful for comparing the distribution of a continuous variable (such as income) across categories (e.g., gender, product type). It combines aspects of both box plots and kernel density plots, showing the spread and density of the data. In this case, it can be used to compare the income distribution between different customer types (e.g., gender or product preference).\n",
      "\n",
      "Column Mapping:\n",
      "\n",
      "x: Gender (Categorical column describing the gender of customers)\n",

      "# Final Instructions:\n",
      "1. Choose Visualizations Carefully: Select visualizations that best match the datasetâ€™s characteristics and user goals. For instance, use line charts for time-based data, bar charts for categorical comparisons, and scatter plots for numerical relationships. Remember that the visualizations shouldn't require the dataset to be changed in anyway (you cannot modify the data for input in the chosen visualizations)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Column-to-Input Mappings: Ensure that the column names are mapped correctly to each visualizationâ€™s input fields (e.g., X-axis, Y-axis).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Provide Clear Rationale: Justify each visualization choice in terms of the insights it provides, explaining how the visualization will help the user understand the datasetâ€™s structure.\n",

      "1. Choose Visualizations Carefully: Select visualizations that best match the datasetâ€™s characteristics and user goals. For instance, use line charts for time-based data, bar charts for categorical comparisons, and scatter plots for numerical relationships. Remember that the visualizations shouldn't require the dataset to be changed in anyway (you cannot modify the data for input in the chosen visualizations)\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Stacked Area Chart**\n",
      "   **Rationale**: A stacked area chart is useful for visualizing how the contributions of different economic indicators (such as GDP, inflation, unemployment rate) vary over time. It provides a clear picture of the cumulative impact of these factors on the overall economy.\n",
      "   **Column Mapping**:\n",
      "   - `x`: `Year` (Date/Time column, assuming the years are represented as separate columns)\n",
      "   - `y`: Multiple numerical columns (e.g., `2014`, `2015`, `2016`, `2017`, `2018`, `2019`, `2020`, `2021`, `2022`, `2023`)\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Heatmap**\n",
